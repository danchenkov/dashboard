# JavaScript: Interactive Analytics Dashboard

## Mission
Build a browser dashboard that loads local JSON datasets, renders widgets, filters and aggregates data, saves layouts, and supports undo/redo.

**Time budget:** 90 consecutive calendar days, approximately 60 minutes per day. Days 1–3 set up the project; days 4–72 cover 23 classical patterns at three days each; days 73–86 cover seven supplemental topics at two days each; days 87–90 are integration and review. This means **one pattern per three days in this language**, not one pattern per day across all three languages. If studying all three simultaneously, budget about three hours per day or stagger the tracks.

## Ground rules
- Write all application and test code yourself. This document provides requirements, not solutions.
- Before implementing each pattern, write a short baseline solution without it or describe the existing pain point.
- After implementation, record why the pattern helps, its cost, two other plausible use cases, and a case where it should not be used.
- Use at least two positive tests and one negative/edge test per assignment; preserve all previous behavior.
- Do not force inheritance-based textbook structures into languages where functions, interfaces, composition, or framework facilities are simpler.
- Commit at the end of every three-day block; use meaningful commit messages.

## Initial scope and setup: days 1–3
Create an HTML entry page, ES modules, local JSON fixtures, CSS and tests using Node’s built-in test runner. Use a small local static server, native DOM APIs and fetch; avoid React/Vue and charting libraries until the final optional extension. Begin with one table widget and one dataset.

## Daily rhythm
**First day of each three-day pattern block:** 15 minutes reading, 15 minutes identifying the change pressure, 30 minutes drafting an interface and tests. **Second day:** 10 minutes revisiting the design, 40 minutes implementing, 10 minutes testing. **Third day:** 30 minutes edge cases and refactoring, 20 minutes explaining trade-offs and two additional use cases, 10 minutes committing. For a faster one-day variant, combine the three stages in a 60-minute focused session with a smaller scope.

### Three required written references for every pattern
1. **GoF:** Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides, *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* (1994), chapter for the named pattern. For supplemental patterns use Fowler, *Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture*, or the official platform documentation instead.
2. **Refactoring.Guru:** https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns — open the named pattern and read Intent, Problem, Solution, Applicability, and Pros/Cons. For supplemental patterns, use https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/ and the platform-specific references below.
3. **Pattern Garden:** https://designpatterns.guru/ — locate the named pattern and compare the illustrated use case. For supplemental patterns, substitute the relevant official documentation below.

Platform-specific written references: Go https://go.dev/doc/effective_go and https://go.dev/doc/ ; Rails https://guides.rubyonrails.org/ ; JavaScript https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API . No videos are required. Read references for understanding; do not copy example implementations into the project.

- **Day 90:** Demonstrate the application, run the full test suite, explain five randomly selected patterns without notes, and submit a short architecture decision record for the most consequential design choice.

## Evaluation rubric
A pattern is complete only if the feature works, tests cover normal and failure behavior, the trainee can state the concrete change pressure it addresses, and can articulate why a simpler implementation might be preferable. Prioritize maintainability and clear behavior over pattern count.
